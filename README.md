# Overview

I created this project to learn more about JavaScript and web mapping. I developed an interactive map application that displays historical monuments and parks in Mexico City using the Leaflet library. This project allowed me to imporve my skills in working with APIs and handling geographic data.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my development environment. The primary language for this project was JavaScript.

I utilized the Leaflet library for mapping, along with the Overpass API to fetch geographic data for historical monuments and parks in Mexico City. The project also included HTML and CSS for the frontend design.
